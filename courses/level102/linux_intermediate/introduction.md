# Linux-Intermediate

## Prerequisites 

- Expect to have gone through the School Of SRE [<u>Linux Basics</u>](https://linkedin.github.io/school-of-sre/level101/linux_basics/intro/).

## What to expect from this course

 This course is divided into two sections. In the first section we will cover where we left off the Linux Basics, earlier in the School of SRE curriculum, we will deep dive into some of the more advanced linux commands and concepts.
 
 In this second section we will discuss how we use Bash scripting in day to day work, automation and toil reduction as an SRE with the help of real life examples of any SRE.

## What is not covered under this course

This course aims to make you familiar with the intersection of Linux commands, shell scripting and how SRE uses it. We would not be covering Linux internals.


## Lab Environment Setup

- Install docker on your system. [<u>https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/</u>](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
    
- We would be using RedHat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.

- We would be running most of the commands in the above docker container.
